You are one of twenty agents working in parallel. Eighteen of you build the Go v9 factory on branch `next` of KaaS-team/KaaS-factory, each in your own packages; one works in auditor and one in blueprint. Stay inside your area.

## Ticket: GitHub App auth and self-update

Two pieces from owainlewis/machinist (MIT, Go): GitHub App installation tokens, so an org runs the factory as an app and not a person, and a self-updater.

Read first: machinist's `internal/githubauth` and `internal/updater` (clone `--depth 1 https://github.com/owainlewis/machinist ../machinist`; it is public). Copy files with the `// Ported from owainlewis/machinist@<sha> <path>` header and add the notices section, or write fresh code if adapting is cleaner.

Design to follow:
- `githubauth.App{ID, PrivateKeyPEM, InstallationID}` with `Token(ctx)` returning a cached installation token refreshed 5 minutes before expiry. JWT signing with the standard library only. The private key is read from a file path or env var name, never a flag value.
- `selfupdate.Check(ctx, current string, src Source) (Release, bool, error)` and `Apply` that downloads the release asset for GOOS/GOARCH, verifies its sha256 from the checksums file, and replaces the binary atomically. `Source` is an interface; the real one reads GitHub releases of KaaS-team/factory.

## Acceptance

- [ ] JWT: claims (iat 60s back, exp 10 min, iss app id) signed RS256 verify with the public key.
- [ ] Token is cached and refreshed only inside the 5-minute window (fake clock, fake server counts calls).
- [ ] Self-update refuses an asset whose sha256 does not match, and leaves the old binary in place.
- [ ] Apply replaces the binary through a rename in the same directory (test in a temp dir).
- [ ] No test touches the network.

## Setup

1. `git fetch origin && git checkout -b go/ghapp-update origin/next`.
2. `go version`. `next` needs Go 1.26; if yours is older, run `export GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` and every go command fetches the right one.
3. `just --version`. If `just` is missing, run the recipe bodies in `justfile` by hand: `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`, `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.7 go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.13.2 run ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./cmd/factory`. Say so in the report. Chain gate and push with `&&`, never `;`. Use `git fetch -q`.
4. Read `AGENTS.md`, `internal/api/api.go` and `internal/api/porttest/fakes.go` before writing code.
5. The Symphony spec, our scheduler contract, is on the brief branch: `git show origin/cloud-briefs:symphony-spec.md > /tmp/symphony-spec.md`. Cite its section numbers in test names or comments. Other KaaS repos may not be clonable from here; when a ticket names one you cannot reach, use the shapes the ticket gives and say so in the report.

The TypeScript tree (`src/`, `tests/`, `dashboard/`, `scripts/`) is the frozen v8 factory at tag `ts-final`. Read it to port behaviour and formats; never edit it.

## Your area

`internal/githubauth/` and `internal/selfupdate/`

You may also add a dependency to `go.mod`/`go.sum` when the ticket names it. Any other file is outside your area: if you truly need one, make the smallest edit and list it in the report.

Eighteen sessions build on `next` at the same time, each in its own packages. Never edit `internal/api/` (if a port is wrong, define the narrow interface you need inside your package and describe the change you want under "API change requests"), `cmd/`, `justfile`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/`, `.factory/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `scripts/kaas/` or the TS tree.

## Order of work

For each acceptance line: write the test, watch it fail, write the code, watch it pass. Port behaviour from the TS file named in the ticket and keep its wire formats byte for byte (markers, comment bodies, argv). A file copied from another repo starts with `// Ported from <repo>@<sha> <path>` and only from MIT or Apache-2.0 code; add its `## <repo>@<sha>` section to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (the provenance test fails otherwise).

Commit with `git commit -s`, one commit per acceptance group, and push after each: `git push -u origin go/ghapp-update`. Run `just fast` before every push and `just check` before the last one.

## Checkpoints, before every commit

1. Area: every changed file is in your area or listed under "Files outside my area".
2. Scope: the diff serves only an acceptance line below. No refactor of other packages, no extra feature.
3. Meaning: each acceptance line still means what it says. If it cannot be met, record it blocked; never weaken it.
4. Proof: you saw each new test fail before the code and pass after.
5. No network, real token or model call in any test. Fakes from `internal/api/porttest` or a local `httptest.Server` only.

## Rules

- Tests are table tests where a rule has branches; every branch of a decision function has a row.
- No `ANTHROPIC_*` or other provider key in code, tests or env. No model name, token count or cost in any PR body or customer-facing text.
- No global state, no `init()` side effects, no goroutine without a context that stops it.
- Exported names get one-line doc comments that say what the code does, nothing it does not.
- No em dashes in prose. Plain sentences.
- Do not comment on, label or close issues, and do not open a PR. Never force-push or push to `next` or `main`.
- No session URL, `claude.ai` link or `Claude-Session:` trailer in any commit or file.
- If one acceptance line is blocked, record why and continue with the next.

## When you finish

Write the report below to a file outside the repo, then push it to its own branch with these commands (the supervisor's log cuts long messages short, and a repo hook refuses writes under `.factory/`):

```
b=$(git hash-object -w /tmp/report.md); t=$(printf '100644 blob %s\treport.md\n' "$b" | git mktree); c=$(git commit-tree "$t" -m report); git push origin "$c:refs/heads/report/v9-ghapp-update"
```

Your final message is then that same report, exactly:

```
BRANCH: go/ghapp-update
HEAD: <full sha you pushed, checked with git ls-remote>
## Summary
<one or two sentences>
## Acceptance
- <line> -> <test name> -> done | blocked (why)
## API change requests
<each, or none>
## Files outside my area
<each, with why, or none>
## Gate evidence
<last lines of `just check`, verbatim>
## Learnings
<what cost time; what the factory's defaults should do instead. One line each.>
```
