You are one of about 50 agents working in parallel: 12 build slices of the factory on `next`, 8 in kaasbot, others research open source. Each build ticket below comes from a research session that read the upstream code at a pinned SHA. Your job is to copy or port the named upstream pieces (MIT or Apache-2.0 only; first line of a copied or ported file is `// Ported from <repo>@<sha> <path>`, plus a `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` section), not to redesign them. Stay inside your area.

Clone the upstream at the pinned SHA: `git clone https://github.com/<repo> /tmp/up && git -C /tmp/up checkout <sha>`. If the report left a licence question open (for example a dependency or grammar file), check it first and skip the piece if it is not MIT or Apache-2.0.

## Ticket: ordered permission ruleset in agent presets, unattended settle rule

Never the skip-permissions flag.

## Acceptance

The acceptance lines of your ticket drafts below, each with a test. Bite-check: revert each fix once and watch its test fail; say so in the report. Anything left out is listed with the reason.

### From research report `opencode` (your tickets: #1; the others belong to other sessions)

Copy list:

| upstream path@sha | licence | lines | replaces or adds in ours | adaptation needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| packages/protocol/openapi.json@a1aa513 | MIT | 31000 lines, 170 operationIds (spec, generated) | adds: generate a Go client for the opencode server API if we ever drive an opencode server as a worker backend | Run oapi-codegen; trim to session/permission/event groups; spec is "experimental", pin SHA |
| packages/core/src/permission.ts@a1aa513 (evaluate, Unattended logic, lines 55-210) | MIT | about 150 | replaces our agent-preset permission flags with a rule list; adds unattended settle | Port to Go (about 80 lines); no Effect needed; Wildcard.match is a simple glob |
| packages/core/src/managed-policy.ts@a1aa513 | MIT | 65 | adds a data-only policy floor beneath gate CEL and ee | Port to Go (about 40 lines); keep CEL for rich rules |
| packages/server/src/auth.ts@a1aa513 | MIT | 66 | adds local dispatcher server auth (HMAC session tokens, rotation revokes) | Port to Go crypto/hmac plus subtle.ConstantTimeCompare |
| packages/cli/src/acp/translate.ts, turn.ts, permission.ts@a1aa513 | MIT | 495 + 474 + 202 | adds a reference table for the kaasbot ACP preset (event to session/update mapping, permission options) | Reference only in practice: TS/Effect, different SDK; port the mapping, not the code |
(Line counts are `wc -l` at the SHA.)

Ticket drafts:

1. **area: agent preset.** Goal: replace unattended permission flags with an ordered `{action, resource, effect}` ruleset, last match wins, plus an Unattended settle rule (deny anything not explicitly allowed). Acceptance: table-driven Go tests ported from core/src/permission.ts cases; a preset with no allow rule denies a write; configured deny beats unattended allow; no more than about 100 Go lines.
2. **area: local dispatcher.** Goal: add auth to the local dispatcher endpoint: password plus HMAC session tokens derived from the password, constant-time compare, loopback bind by default. Acceptance: rotating the password invalidates old tokens; unauthenticated request returns 401; no token accepted in a query string.
3. **area: local dispatcher.** Goal: spike (research only, 1 day) a lossy SSE event stream plus REST re-sync contract for dispatcher status, modelled on GET /api/event. Acceptance: written note with the event list, reconnect rule, and a measured comparison of per-ticket startup time with and without a resident worker.

## Measures (put both in the report)

- Non-test Go lines before and after: `git ls-files '*.go' | grep -v _test.go | grep -v '^src/' | xargs cat | wc -l`.
- Deadcode before and after: `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.7 go run golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode@v0.39.0 ./... | wc -l`.
The repo is 20357 lines against an 8000-line budget. Prefer deleting to adding. Nothing you add may be unreachable from `cmd/factory`.

## Lessons from K3 and K4

- `deadcode` and `golangci-lint` need `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.7`.
- `internal/conformance` pins exported names; if you rename one, fix the three lines there and list it.
- Wiring adds lines. Delete what your change makes redundant in the same commit.

## Setup

1. `git fetch origin && git checkout -b go/k5-preset-rules origin/next`.
2. `go version`. `next` needs Go 1.26; if yours is older, run `export GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` and every go command fetches the right one.
3. `just --version`. If `just` is missing, run the recipe bodies in `justfile` by hand: `gofmt -l .`, `go vet ./...`, `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.7 go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@v2.13.2 run ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./cmd/factory`. Say so in the report. Chain gate and push with `&&`, never `;`. Use `git fetch -q`.
4. Read `AGENTS.md`, `internal/api/api.go` and `internal/api/porttest/fakes.go` before writing code.
5. The Symphony spec, our scheduler contract, is on the brief branch: `git show origin/cloud-briefs:symphony-spec.md > /tmp/symphony-spec.md`. Cite its section numbers in test names or comments. Other KaaS repos may not be clonable from here; when a ticket names one you cannot reach, use the shapes the ticket gives and say so in the report.

The TypeScript tree (`src/`, `tests/`, `dashboard/`, `scripts/`) is the frozen v8 factory at tag `ts-final`. Read it to port behaviour and formats; never edit it.

## Your area

agent preset files under `internal/` that hold the claude/codex/opencode presets

You may also add a dependency to `go.mod`/`go.sum` when the ticket names it. Any other file is outside your area: if you truly need one, make the smallest edit and list it in the report.

Twelve sessions work on `next` at the same time, each in its own packages. Never edit `internal/api/` (if a port is wrong, define the narrow interface you need inside your package and describe the change you want under "API change requests"), `cmd/`, `justfile`, `AGENTS.md`, `.github/`, `.factory/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `scripts/kaas/` or the TS tree.

## Order of work

For each acceptance line: write the test, watch it fail, write the code, watch it pass. Port behaviour from the TS file named in the ticket and keep its wire formats byte for byte (markers, comment bodies, argv). A file copied from another repo starts with `// Ported from <repo>@<sha> <path>` and only from MIT or Apache-2.0 code; add its `## <repo>@<sha>` section to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (the provenance test fails otherwise).

Commit with `git commit -s`, one commit per acceptance group, and push after each: `git push -u origin go/k5-preset-rules`. Run `just fast` before every push and `just check` before the last one.

## Checkpoints, before every commit

1. Area: every changed file is in your area or listed under "Files outside my area".
2. Scope: the diff serves only an acceptance line below. No refactor of other packages, no extra feature.
3. Meaning: each acceptance line still means what it says. If it cannot be met, record it blocked; never weaken it.
4. Proof: you saw each new test fail before the code and pass after.
5. No network, real token or model call in any test. Fakes from `internal/api/porttest` or a local `httptest.Server` only.

## Rules

- Tests are table tests where a rule has branches; every branch of a decision function has a row.
- No `ANTHROPIC_*` or other provider key in code, tests or env. No model name, token count or cost in any PR body or customer-facing text.
- No global state, no `init()` side effects, no goroutine without a context that stops it.
- Exported names get one-line doc comments that say what the code does, nothing it does not.
- No em dashes in prose. Plain sentences.
- Do not comment on, label or close issues, and do not open a PR. Never force-push or push to `next` or `main`.
- No session URL, `claude.ai` link or `Claude-Session:` trailer in any commit or file.
- If one acceptance line is blocked, record why and continue with the next.

## When you finish

Write the report below to a file outside the repo, then push it to its own branch with these commands (the supervisor's log cuts long messages short, and a repo hook refuses writes under `.factory/`):

```
b=$(git hash-object -w /tmp/report.md); t=$(printf '100644 blob %s\treport.md\n' "$b" | git mktree); c=$(git commit-tree "$t" -m report); git push origin "$c:refs/heads/report/v9-k5-preset-rules"
```

Your final message is then that same report, exactly:

```
BRANCH: go/k5-preset-rules
HEAD: <full sha you pushed, checked with git ls-remote>
## Summary
<one or two sentences>
## Acceptance
- <line> -> <test name> -> done | blocked (why)
## API change requests
<each, or none>
## Files outside my area
<each, with why, or none>
## Gate evidence
<last lines of `just check`, verbatim>
## Learnings
<what cost time; what the factory's defaults should do instead. One line each.>
```
